  <p>African elephants (Loxodonta) are a genus comprising two living elephant species, the African bush elephant (L.
    africana) and the smaller African forest elephant (L. cyclotis). Both are social herbivores with grey skin, but
    differ in the size and colour of their tusks and in the shape and size of their ears and skulls.
    Both species are considered at heavy risk of extinction on the IUCN Red List; as of 2021, the bush elephant is
    considered endangered and the forest elephant is considered critically endangered. They are threatened by habitat
    loss and fragmentation, and poaching for the illegal ivory trade is a threat in several range countries as well.
    Loxodonta is one of two extant genera of the family Elephantidae. The name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of
    their molar teeth. Fossil remains of Loxodonta species have been excavated in Africa, dating to the Middle Pliocene.

    The first scientific description of the African elephant was written in 1797 by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who
    proposed the scientific name Elephas africanus.[2] Loxodonte was proposed as a generic name for the African elephant
    by Frédéric Cuvier in 1825. This name refers to the lozenge-shaped enamel of the molar teeth, which differs
    significantly from the rounded shape of the Asian elephant's molar enamel.[3] An anonymous author used the Latinized
    spelling Loxodonta in 1827.[4] Anonymous was recognized as authority by the International Code of Zoological
    Nomenclature in 1999.[1]
    Elephas (Loxodonta) cyclotis was proposed by Paul Matschie in 1900, who described three African elephant zoological
    specimens from Cameroon whose skulls differed in shape from elephant skulls collected elsewhere in Africa.[5] In
    1936, Glover Morrill Allen considered this elephant to be a distinct species and called it 'forest elephant';[6]
    later authors considered it to be a subspecies.[7][8][9] Morphological and genetic analyses provided evidence for
    species-level differences between the African bush elephant and the African forest elephant.[10][11][12][13][14]
    In 1907, Richard Lydekker proposed six African elephant subspecies based on the different sizes and shapes of their
    ears.[15] They are all considered synonymous with the African bush elephant.[1]
    A third species, the West African elephant, has also been proposed but it needs confirmation. It is thought that
    this lineage has been isolated from the others for 2.4 million years.[16]
    Extinct African elephants[edit]
    Between the late 18th and 21st centuries, the following extinct African elephants were described on the basis of
    fossil remains:
    • North African elephant (Loxodonta africana pharaohensis) proposed by Paulus Edward Pieris Deraniyagala in 1948 was
    a specimen from Fayum in Egypt.[17]
    • Loxodonta atlantica was proposed as Elephas atlanticus by Auguste Pomel in 1879 based on a skull and bones found
    in Ternifine, Algeria.[18]
    • Loxodonta exoptata proposed by Wilhelm Otto Dietrich in 1941 was based on teeth found in Laetoli, Tanzania.[19]
    • Loxodonta adaurora proposed by Vincent Maglio in 1970 was a complete skeleton found in Kanapoi, Kenya.[20]
    • Loxodonta cookei proposed by William J. Sanders in 2007 based on teeth found in the Varswater Formation at
    Langebaanweg, South Africa.[21]
    Phylogeny[edit]
    Analysis of nuclear DNA sequences indicates that the genetic divergence between African bush and forest elephants
    dates 2.6 – 5.6 million years ago. The divergence between the Asian elephant and the woolly mammoths is estimated
    2.5 – 5.4 million years ago, which strongly supports their status as distinct species. The African forest elephant
    was found to have a high degree of genetic diversity, perhaps reflecting periodic fragmentation of their habitat
    during the climatic changes in the Pleistocene.[13]
    Gene flow between the two African elephant species was examined at 21 locations. The analysis revealed that several
    African bush elephants carried mitochondrial DNA of African forest elephants, indicating they hybridised in the
    savanna-forest transition zone in ancient times.[22]
    Sequence analysis of DNA from fossils of the extinct Eurasian Palaeoloxodon antiquus shows it to be much closer
    related to the African forest elephant than to the African bush elephant. The validity of Palaeoloxodon has
    therefore been questioned.[23]
    Description[edit]

    Skin, ears, and trunk[edit]

    A male African bush elephant skull on display at the Museum of Osteology
    African elephants have grey folded skin up to 30 mm (1.2 in) thick that is covered with sparse, bristled dark-brown
    to black hair. Short tactile hair grows on the trunk, which has two finger-like processes at the tip, whereas Asian
    elephants only have one.[7] Their large ears help to reduce body heat; flapping them creates air currents and
    exposes the ears' inner sides where large blood vessels increase heat loss during hot weather. The trunk is a
    prehensile elongation of its upper lip and nose. This highly sensitive organ is innervated primarily by the
    trigeminal nerve, and thought to be manipulated by about 40,000–60,000 muscles. Because of this muscular structure,
    the trunk is so strong that elephants can use it for lifting about 3% of their own body weight. They use it for
    smelling, touching, feeding, drinking, dusting, producing sounds, loading, defending and attacking.[24] Elephants
    sometimes swim underwater and use their trunks as snorkels.[25][26]
    Tusks and molars[edit]
    Both male and female African elephants have tusks that grow from deciduous teeth called tushes, which are replaced
    by tusks when calves are about one year old. Tusks are composed of dentin, which forms small diamond-shaped
    structures in the tusk's center that become larger at its periphery.[24] Tusks are primarily used to dig for roots
    and strip the bark from trees for food, for fighting each other during mating season, and for defending themselves
    against predators. The tusks weigh from 23 to 45 kg (51–99 lb) and can be from 1.5 to 2.4 m (5–8 ft) long. They are
    curved forward and continue to grow throughout the elephant's lifetime.[27]
    The dental formula of elephants is 1.0.3.30.0.3.3 × 2 = 26.[24] Elephants have four molars; each weighs about 5 kg
    (11 lb) and measures about 30 cm (12 in) long. As the front pair wears down and drops out in pieces, the back pair
    moves forward, and two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth. Elephants replace their teeth four to six times
    in their lifetimes. At around 40 to 60 years of age, the elephant loses the last of its molars and will likely die
    of starvation which is a common cause of death. African elephants have 24 teeth in total, six on each quadrant of
    the jaw. The enamel plates of the molars are fewer in number than in Asian elephants.[28]
    Size[edit]
    The African bush elephant is the largest terrestrial animal. Cows are 2.2–2.6 m (7.2–8.5 ft) tall at the shoulder
    and weigh 2,160–3,232 kg (4,762–7,125 lb), while bulls are 3.2–4 m (10–13 ft) tall and weigh 4,700–6,048 kg
    (10,362–13,334 lb).[7] Its back is concave-shaped, while the back of the African forest elephant is nearly
    straight.[10] The largest recorded individual stood 3.96 metres (13.0 ft) at the shoulder, and is estimated to have
    weighed 10,400 kg (22,900 lb).[29] The tallest recorded individual stood 4.21 m (13.8 ft) at the shoulder and
    weighed 8,000 kg (18,000 lb).[30]
    The African forest elephant is smaller with a weight of up 4,000 kg (8,800 lb) and a shoulder height of 1.8–2.4 m (5
    ft 11 in – 7 ft 10 in) in females and 2.4–3 m (7 ft 10 in – 9 ft 10 in) in males.[10] It is the third largest
    terrestrial animal.[31]
    Distribution and habitat[edit]

    African elephants are distributed in Sub-Saharan Africa, where they inhabit Sahelian scrubland and arid regions,
    tropical rainforests, mopane and miombo woodlands. African forest elephant populations occur only in Central
    Africa.[32]
    Behavior and ecology[edit]
    Sleeping pattern[edit]
    Elephants are the animals with the lowest sleep times, especially African elephants. Their average sleep was found
    to be only 2 hours in 24-hour cycles.
    Family[edit]</p>

  <p>Bull elephants in mock aggression
    Both African elephant species live in family units comprising several adult cows, their daughters and their subadult
    sons. Each family unit is led by an older cow known as the matriarch.[33][34] African forest elephant groups are
    less cohesive than African bush elephant groups, probably because of the lack of predators.[34]
    When separate family units bond, they form kinship or bond groups. After puberty, male elephants tend to form close
    alliances with other males. While females are the most active members of African elephant groups, both male and
    female elephants are capable of distinguishing between hundreds of different low frequency infrasonic calls to
    communicate with and identify each other.[35][36]
    Elephants use some vocalisations that are beyond the hearing range of humans,[37] to communicate across large
    distances. Elephant mating rituals include the gentle entwining of trunks.[38]
    The bulls were believed to be solitary animals, becoming independent once reaching maturity. New research suggests
    that bulls maintain ecological knowledge for the herd, facilitating survival when searching for food and water,
    which also benefits the young bulls who associate with them. Bulls only return to the herd to breed or to socialize;
    they do not provide prenatal care to their offspring, but rather play a fatherly role to younger bulls to show
    dominance.[39]
    Feeding[edit]
    While feeding, the African elephant uses its trunk to pluck leaves and its tusk to tear at branches, which can cause
    enormous damage to foliage.[27] Fermentation of the food takes place in the hindgut, thus enabling large food
    intakes.[40] The large size and hindgut of the African elephant also allows for digestion of various plant parts,
    including fibrous stems, bark and roots.[41]
    Intelligence[edit]

    African elephants are highly intelligent.[42] They have a very large and highly convoluted neocortex, a trait they
    share with humans, apes and some dolphin species. They are amongst the world's most intelligent species. With a mass
    of just over 5 kg (11 lb), the elephant brain is larger than that of any other terrestrial animal. The elephant's
    brain is similar to a human brain in terms of structure and complexity; the elephant's cortex has as many neurons as
    that of a human brain,[43] suggesting convergent evolution.[44]
    Elephants exhibit a wide variety of behaviours, including those associated with grief, learning, mimicry, art, play,
    a sense of humor, altruism, use of tools, compassion, cooperation,[45] self-awareness, memory and possibly
    language.[46] All of these behaviors point to a highly intelligent species that is thought to be equal with
    cetaceans[47][48] and primates.[48]
    Reproduction[edit]
    African elephants are at their most fertile between the ages of 25 and 45. Calves are born after a gestation period
    of up to nearly two years.[31] The calves are cared for by their mother and other young females in the group, known
    as allomothering.[33]
    African elephants show sexual dimorphism in weight and shoulder height by age 20, due to the rapid early growth of
    males. By age 25, males are double the weight of females; however, both sexes continue to grow throughout their
    lives.
    Female African elephants are able to start reproducing at around 10 to 12 years of age,[49] and are in estrus for
    about 2 to 7 days. They do not mate at a specific time; however, they are less likely to reproduce in times of
    drought than when water is plentiful. The gestation period of an elephant is 22 months and fertile females usually
    give birth every 3–6 years, so if they live to around 50 years of age, they may produce 7 offspring. Females are a
    scarce and mobile resource for the males so there is intense competition to gain access to estrous females.
    Post sexual maturity, males begin to experience musth, a physical and behavioral condition that is characterized by
    elevated testosterone, aggression and more sexual activity.[50][51] Musth also serves a purpose of calling attention
    to the females that they are of good quality, and it cannot be mimicked as certain calls or noises may be. Males
    sire few offspring in periods when they are not in musth. During the middle of estrus, female elephants look for
    males in musth to guard them. The females will yell, in a loud, low way to attract males from far away. Male
    elephants can also smell the hormones of a female ready for breeding. This leads males to compete with each other to
    mate, which results in the females mating with older, healthier males.[52] Females choose to a point who they mate
    with, since they are the ones who try to get males to compete to guard them. However, females are not guarded in the
    early and late stages of estrus, which may permit mating by younger males not in musth.[citation needed]
    Males over the age of 25 compete strongly for females in estrus, and are more successful the larger and more
    aggressive they are.[51] Bigger males tend to sire bigger offspring.[53] Wild males begin breeding in their thirties
    when they are at a size and weight that is competitive with other adult males. Male reproductive success is maximal
    in mid-adulthood and then begins to decline. However, this can depend on the ranking of the male within their group,
    as higher-ranking males maintain a higher rate of reproduction.[54] Most observed matings are by males in musth over
    35 years of age. Twenty-two long observations showed that age and musth are extremely important factors; "… older
    males had markedly elevated paternity success compared with younger males, suggesting the possibility of sexual
    selection for longevity in this species."[55]: 287 [full citation needed]
    Males usually stay with a female and her herd for about a month before moving on in search of another mate. Less
    than a third of the population of female elephants will be in estrus at any given time and the gestation period of
    an elephant is long, so it makes more evolutionary sense for a male to search for as many females as possible rather
    than stay with one group.[citation needed]
    Threats[edit]

    Both species are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and poaching for the illegal ivory trade is a threat
    in several range countries as well. The African bush elephant is listed as Endangered and the African forest
    elephant as Critically Endangered on the respective IUCN Red Lists.[56][57]
    Based on vegetation types that provide suitable habitat for African elephants, it was estimated that in the early
    19th century a maximum of 26,913,000 African elephants might have been present from the Sahel in the north to the
    Highveld in the south. Decrease of suitable habitat was the major cause for the decline of elephant populations
    until the 1950s. Hunting African elephants for the ivory trade accelerated the decline from the 1970s onwards. The
    carrying capacity of remaining suitable habitats was estimated at 8,985,000 elephants at most by 1987.[58] In the
    1970s and 1980s, the price for ivory rose, and poaching for ivory increased in particular in Central African range
    countries where access to elephant habitats was facilitated by logging and petroleum mining industries.[32] Between
    1976 and 1980, about 830 t (820 long tons; 910 short tons) raw ivory was exported from Africa to Hong Kong and
    Japan, equivalent to tusks of about 222,000 African elephants.[59]
    The first continental elephant census was carried out in 1976. At the time, 1.34 million elephants were estimated to
    range over 7,300,000 km2 (2,800,000 sq mi).[60] In the 1980s, it was difficult to carry out systematic surveys in
    several East African range countries due to civil wars.[32] In 1987, it was estimated that the African elephant
    population had declined to 760,000 individuals. In 1989, only 608,000 African elephants were estimated to have
    survived.[60] In 1989, the Kenyan Wildlife Service burned a stockpile of tusks in protest against the ivory
    trade.[61]
    When the international ivory trade reopened in 2006, the demand and price for ivory increased in Asia. In Chad's
    Zakouma National Park, more than 3,200 elephants were killed between 2005 and 2010. The park did not have sufficient
    guards to combat poaching and their weapons were outdated. Well organized networks facilitated smuggling the ivory
    through Sudan.[62] The government of Tanzania estimated that more than 85,000 elephants were lost to poaching in
    Tanzania between 2009 and 2014, representing a 60% loss.[63] In 2012, a large upsurge in ivory poaching was
    reported, with about 70% of the product flowing to China.[64] China was the biggest market for poached ivory but
    announced that it would phase out the legal domestic manufacture and sale of ivory products in May 2015.[65]
    Conflicts between elephants and a growing human population are a major issue in elephant conservation.[32] Human
    encroachment into natural areas where bush elephants occur or their increasing presence in adjacent areas has
    spurred research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans. Playback of the recorded
    sounds of angry Western honey bees has been found to be remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an
    area.[66] Farmers have tried scaring elephants away by more aggressive means such as fire or the use of chili
    peppers along fences to protect their crops.[67]</p>
