  <p>Animal culture can be defined as the ability of non-human animals to learn and transmit behaviors through processes
    of social or cultural learning.[1][2][3][4] Culture is increasingly seen as a process, involving the social
    transmittance of behavior among peers and between generations. It can involve the transmission of novel behaviors[5]
    or regional variations that are independent of genetic or ecological factors.[6]
    The existence of culture in non-humans has been a contentious subject, sometimes forcing researchers to rethink
    "what it is to be human".[6] The notion of culture in other animals dates back to Aristotle in classical antiquity,
    and more recently to Charles Darwin, but the association of other animals' actions with the actual word 'culture'
    originated with Japanese primatologists' discoveries of socially-transmitted food behaviours in the 1940s.[7]
    Evidence for animal culture is often based on studies of feeding behaviors,[8] vocalizations,[4] predator
    avoidance,[9] mate selection,[10] and migratory routes.[11]
    An important area of study for animal culture is vocal learning, the ability to make new sounds through
    imitation.[4] Most species cannot learn to imitate sounds. Some can learn how to use innate vocalizations in new
    ways. Only a few species can learn new calls.[3] The transmission of vocal repertoires, including some types of bird
    vocalization, can be viewed as social processes involving cultural transmission.[4] Some evidence suggests that the
    ability to engage in vocal learning depends on the development of specialized brain circuitry, detected in humans,
    dolphins, bats and some birds. The lack of common ancestors suggests that the basis for vocal learning has evolved
    independently through evolutionary convergence.[3]
    Animal culture can be an important consideration in conservation management. As of 2020, culture and sociality were
    included in the aspects of the management framework of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of
    Wild Animals (CMS).[9][12][13]
    Organizational culture[edit]
    One definition of culture, particularly in relation to the organizational aspect is the utilization of "involvement,
    consistency, adaptation, and mission."[15] Cultural traits that are indicators of a successful form of organization
    are more likely to be assimilated into our everyday lives. Organizations that utilize the four aforementioned
    aspects of culture are the ones that are the most successful. Therefore, cultures that are better able to involve
    their citizens towards a common goal have a much higher rate of effectiveness than those who do not have a shared
    goal. A further definition of culture is, "[s]ocially transmitted behavior patterns that serve to relate human
    communities to their ecological settings."[15] This definition connects cultural behavior to the environment. Since
    culture is a form of adaptation to one's environment, it is mirrored in many aspects of our current and past
    societies.
    Cultural sociology[edit]
    Other researchers are currently exploring the idea that there is a connection between cultural sociology and
    psychology. Certain individuals are especially concerned with the analysis of studies connecting "identity,
    collective memory, social classification, logics of action, and framing."[16] Views of what exactly culture is has
    been changing due to the recent convergence of sociological and psychological thought on the subject. "Recent work
    depicts culture as fragmented across groups and inconsistent across its manifestations. The view of culture as
    values that diffuse other aspects of belief, intention, and collective life has succumbed to one of culture as
    complex rule-like structures that constitute resources that can be put to strategic use."[16] Culture is specific to
    region and not just one umbrella definition or concept can truly give us the essence of what culture is. Also
    referenced is the importance of symbols and rituals as cognitive building blocks for a psychological concept of
    shared culture.
    Memes and cultural transmission[edit]
    Richard Dawkins argues for the existence of a "unit of cultural transmission" called a meme. This concept of memes
    has become much more accepted as more extensive research has been done into cultural behaviors. Much as one can
    inherit genes from each parent, it is suggested that individuals acquire memes through imitating what they observe
    around them. The more relevant actions (actions that increase ones probability of survival), such as architecture
    and craftwork are more likely to become prevalent, enabling a culture to form. The idea of memes as following a form
    of Natural Selection was first presented by Daniel Dennett. It has also been argued by Dennett that memes are
    responsible for the entirety of human consciousness. He claims that everything that constitutes humanity, such as
    language and music is a result of memes.[17]
    Evolutionary culture[edit]
    A closely related concept to memes is the idea of evolutionary culture. The validity of the concept of evolutionary
    culture has been increasing recently due to the re-evaluation of the term by anthropologists. The broadening scope
    of evolution from simple genes to more abstract concepts, such as designs and behaviors makes the idea of
    evolutionary culture more plausible. Evolutionary culture theory is defined as "a theory of cultural phylogeny."[18]
    The idea that all human culture evolved from one main culture, citing the interconnectedness of languages as one of
    his[whose?] examples, has also been presented.[18] There is, however, also the possibility for disparate ancestral
    cultures, in that the cultures we see today may potentially have stemmed from more than one original culture.
    Culture in animals[edit]
    According to the Webster's dictionary definition of culture, learning and transmission are the two main components
    of culture, specifically referencing tool making and the ability to acquire behaviors that will enhance one's
    quality of life. Using this definition it is possible to conclude that other animals are just as likely to adapt to
    cultural behaviors as humans. One of the first signs of culture in early humans was the utilization of tools.
    Chimpanzees have been observed using tools such as rocks and sticks to obtain better access to food. There are other
    learned activities that have been exhibited by other animals as well. Some examples of these activities that have
    been shown by varied animals are opening oysters, swimming, washing of food, and unsealing tin lids.[19] This
    acquisition and sharing of behaviors correlates directly to the existence of memes. It especially reinforces the
    natural selection component, seeing as these actions employed by other animals are all mechanisms for making their
    lives easier, and therefore longer.
    History of animal culture theory[edit]
    Though the idea of 'culture' in other animals has only been around for just over half of a century, scientists have
    been noting social behaviors of other animals for centuries. Aristotle was the first to provide evidence of social
    learning in the songs of birds.[7] Charles Darwin first attempted to find the existence of imitation in other
    animals when attempting to prove his theory that the human mind had evolved from that of lower beings. Darwin was
    also the first to suggest what became known as social learning in attempting to explain the transmission of an
    adaptive pattern of behavior through a population of honey bees.[20] The vast majority of cultural anthropological
    research has been done on non-human primates, due to their being closest evolutionarily to humans. In non-primate
    animals, research tends to be limited, and therefore evidence for culture strongly lacking. However, the subject has
    become more popular recently, and has prompted the initiation of more research into the area.
    Whiten's Culture in Chimpanzees[edit]
    Andrew Whiten, professor of Evolutionary and Developmental Psychology at the University of St. Andrews, contributed
    to the greater understanding of cultural transmission with his work on chimpanzees. In Cultural Traditions in
    Chimpanzees, Whiten created a compilation of results from seven long-term studies totaling 151 years of observation
    analyzing behavioral patterns in different communities of chimpanzees in Africa (read more about it below). The
    study expanded the notion that cultural behavior lies beyond linguistic mediation, and can be interpreted to include
    distinctive socially learned behavior such as stone-handling and sweet potato washing in Japanese
    macaques.[21][22][23] The implications of their findings indicate that chimpanzee behavioral patterns mimic the
    distinct behavioral variants seen in different human populations in which cultural transmission has generally always
    been an accepted concept.
    Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman models[edit]
    Population geneticists Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman have also been frontrunners in the field of cultural transmission,
    describing behavioral "traits" as characteristics pertaining to a culture that are recognizable within that
    culture.[24] Using a quantifiable approach, Cavalli-Sforza & Feldman were able to produce mathematical models for
    three forms of cultural transmission, each of which have distinct effects on socialization: vertical, horizontal,
    and oblique.
    • Vertical transmission occurs from parents to offspring and is a function which shows that the probability that
    parents of specific types give rise to an offspring of their own or of another type. Vertical transmission, in this
    sense, is similar to genetic transmission in biological evolution as mathematical models for gene transmission
    account for variation. Vertical transmission also contributes strongly to the buildup of between-population
    variation.[24]
    • Horizontal transmission is cultural transmission taking place among peers in a given population. While horizontal
    transmission is expected to result in faster within-group evolution due to the relationship building between peers
    of a population, it is expected to result in less between-group variation than the vertical transmission model would
    allow for.
    • Oblique transmission is cultural transmission being passed from one generation to another younger generation, such
    as is done by teaching, and the result of reproducing information across generations is a rapid loss of variation
    within that specific population. Unlike vertical transmission, oblique transmission doesn't need to occur strictly
    between parent and offspring; it can occur between less-related generations (e.g. from grandparent to grandchild),
    or from an individual to a non-related younger individual of the same species.
    Mechanisms of cultural transmission in animals[edit]
    Cultural transmission, also known as cultural learning, is the process and method of passing on socially learned
    information.[25] Within a species, cultural transmission is greatly influenced by how adults socialize with each
    other and with their young. Differences in cultural transmission across species have been thought to be largely
    affected by external factors, such as the physical environment, that may lead an individual to interpret a
    traditional concept in a novel way. The environmental stimuli that contribute to this variance can include climate,
    migration patterns, conflict, suitability for survival, and endemic pathogens. Cultural transmission can also vary
    according to different social learning strategies employed at the species and or individual level.[26] Cultural
    transmission is hypothesized to be a critical process for maintaining behavioral characteristics in both humans and
    nonhuman animals over time, and its existence relies on innovation, imitation, and communication to create and
    propagate various aspects of animal behavior seen today.[4][3]
    Culture, when defined as the transmission of behaviors from one generation to the next, can be transmitted among
    animals through various methods.[27] The most common of these methods include imitation, teaching, and language.
    Imitation has been found to be one of the most prevalent modes of cultural transmission in non-human animals, while
    teaching and language are much less widespread, with the possible exceptions of primates and cetaceans. Recent
    research has suggested that teaching, as opposed to imitation, may be a characteristic of certain animals who have
    more advanced cultural capacities.
    The likelihood of larger groups within a species developing and sharing these intra-species traditions with peers
    and offspring is much higher than that of one individual spreading some aspect of animal behavior to one or more
    members. Cultural transmission. as opposed to individual learning, is therefore a more efficient manner of spreading
    traditions and allowing members of a species to collectively inherit more adaptive behavior.[28] This process by
    which offspring within a species acquires his or her own culture through mimicry or being introduced to traditions
    is referred to as enculturation. The role of cultural transmission in cultural evolution, then, is to provide the
    outlet for which organisms create and spread traditions that shape patterns of animal behavior visibly over
    generations.
    Genetic vs. cultural transmission[edit]
    Culture, which was once thought of as a uniquely human trait, is now firmly established as a common trait among
    animals and is not merely a set of related behaviors passed on by genetic transmission as some have argued. Genetic
    transmission, like cultural transmission, is a means of passing behavioral traits from one individual to another.
    The main difference is that genetic transmission is the transfer of behavioral traits from one individual to another
    through genes which are transferred to an organism from its parents during the fertilization of the egg. As can be
    seen, genetic transmission can only occur once during the lifetime of an organism.[29] Thus, genetic transmission is
    quite slow compared to the relative speed of cultural transmission. In cultural transmission, behavioral information
    is passed through means of verbal, visual, or written methods of teaching. Therefore, in cultural transmission, new
    behaviors can be learned by many organisms in a matter of days and hours rather than the many years of reproduction
    it would take for a behavior to spread among organisms in genetic transmission.
    Social learning[edit]
    Main article: Social learning in animals
    Culture can be transmitted among animals through various methods, the most common of which include imitation,
    teaching, and language. Imitation is one of the most prevalent modes of cultural transmission in non-human animals,
    while teaching and language are much less widespread. In a study[30] on food acquisition techniques in meerkats
    (Suricata suricatta), researchers found evidence that meerkats learned foraging tricks through imitation of
    conspecifics. The experimental setup consisted of an apparatus containing food with two possible methods that could
    be used to obtain the food. Naïve meerkats learned and used the method exhibited by the "demonstrator" meerkat
    trained in one of the two techniques. Although in this case, imitation is not the clear mechanism of learning given
    that the naïve meerkat could simply have been drawn to certain features of the apparatus from observing the
    "demonstrator" meerkat and from there discovered the technique on their own.
    Teaching[edit]
    Teaching is often considered one mechanism of social learning,[31] and occurs when knowledgeable individuals of some
    species have been known to teach others. For this to occur, a teacher must change its behavior when interacting with
    a naïve individual and incur an initial cost from teaching, while an observer must acquire skills rapidly as a
    direct consequence.
    Until recently, teaching was a skill that was thought to be uniquely human.[31][32] Now, as research has increased
    into the transmission of culture in animals, the role of teaching among animal groups has become apparent. Teaching
    is not merely limited to mammals either. Many insects, for example have been observed demonstrating various forms of
    teaching in order to obtain food. Ants, for example, will guide each other to food sources through a process called
    "tandem running", in which an ant will guide a companion ant to a source of food. It has been suggested that the
    "pupil" ant is able to learn this route in order to obtain food in the future or teach the route to other ants.[33]
    There have been various recent studies that show that cetaceans are able to transmit culture through teaching as
    well. Killer whales are known to "intentionally beach" themselves in order to catch and eat pinnipeds who are
    breeding on the shore. Mother killer whales teach their young to catch pinnipeds by pushing them onto the shore and
    encouraging them to attack and eat the prey. Because the mother killer whale is altering her behavior in order to
    help her offspring learn to catch prey, this is evidence of teaching and cultural learning. The intentional beaching
    of the killer whales, along with other cetacean behaviors such as the variations of songs among humpback whales and
    the sponging technique used by the bottlenose dolphin to obtain food, provide substantial support for the idea of
    cetacean cultural transmission.[34]
    Teaching is arguably the social learning mechanism that affords the highest fidelity of information transfer between
    individuals and generations, and allows a direct pathway through which local traditions can be passed down and
    transmitted.[35]
    Imitation[edit]

    Imitation can be found in a few members of the avian world, in particular the parrot. Imitation forms the basis of
    culture, but does not on its own imply culture.
    Imitation is often misinterpreted as merely the observation and copying of another's actions. This would be known as
    mimicry, because the repetition of the observed action is done for no other purpose than to copy the original doer
    or speaker. In the scientific community, imitation is rather the process in which an organism purposefully observes
    and copies the methods of another in order to achieve a tangible goal.[36] Therefore, the identification and
    classification of animal behavior as being imitation has been very difficult. Recent research into imitation in
    animals has resulted in the tentative labeling of certain species of birds, monkeys, apes, and cetaceans as having
    the capacity for imitation. For example, a Grey parrot by the name of Alex underwent a series of tests and
    experiments at the University of Arizona in which scientist Irene Pepperberg judged his ability to imitate the human
    language in order to create vocalizations and object labels. Through the efforts of Pepperberg, Alex has been able
    to learn a large vocabulary of English words and phrases. Alex can then combine these words and phrases to make
    completely new words which are meaningless, but utilize the phonetic rules of the English language.[37] Alex's
    capabilities of using and understanding more than 80 words, along with his ability to put together short phrases,
    demonstrates how birds, who many people do not credit with having deep intellect, can actually imitate and use
    rudimentary language skills in an effective manner.[38] The results of this experiment culminated with the
    conclusion that the use of the English language to refer to objects is not unique to humans and is arguably true
    imitation, a basic form of cultural learning found in young children.
    Language[edit]
    Language is another key indicator of animals who have greater potential to possess culture. Though animals do not
    naturally use words like humans when they are communicating, the well-known parrot Alex demonstrated that even
    animals with small brains, but are adept at imitation can have a deeper understanding of language after lengthy
    training. A bonobo named Kanzi has taken the use of the English language even further. Kanzi was taught to recognize
    words and their associations by using a lexigram board. Through observation of its mother's language training, Kanzi
    was able to learn how to use the lexigrams to obtain food and other items that he desired.[38] Also, Kanzi is able
    to use his understanding of lexigrams to decipher and comprehend simple sentences.[38] For example, when he was told
    to "give the doggie a shot," Kanzi grabbed a toy dog and a syringe and gave it a realistic injection.[38] This type
    of advanced behavior and comprehension is what scientists have used as evidence for language-based culture in
    animals.
    Primate culture[edit]

    A bonobo fishing for termites using a sharpened stick. Tool usage in acquiring food is believed to be a cultural
    behavior.
    The beginning of the modern era of animal culture research in the middle of the 20th century came with the gradual
    acceptance of the term "culture" in referring to animals. In 1952, Japan's leading primatologist of the time, Kinji
    Imanishi, first introduced the idea of "kaluchua" or "pre-culture" in referring to the now famous potato-washing
    behavior of Japanese macaques.[39]
    In 1948, Imanishi and his colleagues began studying macaques across Japan, and began to notice differences among the
    different groups of primates, both in social patterns and feeding behavior. In one area, paternal care was the
    social norm, while this behavior was absent elsewhere. One of the groups commonly dug up and ate the tubers and
    bulbs of several plants, while monkeys from other groups would not even put these in their mouths. Imanishi reasoned
    that, "if one defines culture as learned by offspring from parents, then differences in the way of life of members
    of the same species belonging to different social groups could be attributed to culture."[40] Following this logic,
    the differences Imanishi and his colleagues observed among the different groups of macaques may suggest that they
    had arisen as a part of the groups' unique cultures.[41]
    The most famous of these eating behaviors was observed on the island of Koshima, where one young female was observed
    carrying soiled sweet potatoes to a small stream, where she proceeded to wash off all of the sand and dirt before
    eating. This behavior was then observed in one of the monkey's playmates, then her mother and a few other playmates.
    The potato-washing eventually spread throughout the whole macaque colony. Imanishi introduced the Japanese term
    kaluchua which was later translated by Masao Kawai and others to refer to the behavior as "pre-culture"[41][42] and
    as being acquired through “pre-cultural propagation".[43] The researchers caution that "we must not overestimate the
    situation and say that 'monkeys have culture' and then confuse it with human culture."[44][7] At this point, most of
    the observed behaviors in animals, like those observed by Imanishi, were related to survival in some way.</p>

  <p>A chimpanzee mother and baby.
    The first evidence of apparently arbitrary traditions came in the late-1970s, also in the behavior of primates. At
    this time, researchers McGrew and Tutin found a social grooming handclasp behavior to be prevalent in a certain
    troop of chimpanzees in Tanzania, but not found in other groups nearby.[7] This grooming behavior involved one
    chimpanzee taking hold of the hand of another and lifting it into the air, allowing the two to groom each other's
    armpits. Though this would seem to make grooming of the armpits easier, the behavior actually has no apparent
    advantage. As the primatologist Frans de Waal explains from his later observations of the hand-clasp grooming
    behavior in a different group of chimpanzees, "A unique property of the handclasp grooming posture is that it is not
    required for grooming the armpit of another individual... Thus it appears to yield no obvious benefits or rewards to
    the groomers."[7]
    Prior to these findings, opponents to the idea of animal culture had argued that the behaviors being called cultural
    were simply behaviors that had evolutionarily evolved due to their importance to survival. After the identification
    of this initial non-evolutionarily advantageous evidence of culture, scientists began to find differences in group
    behaviors or traditions in various groups of primates, specifically in Africa. More than 40 different populations of
    wild chimpanzees have been studied across Africa, between which many species-specific, as well as
    population-specific, behaviors have been observed. The researching scientists found 65 different categories of
    behaviors among these various groups of chimpanzees, including the use of leaves, sticks, branches, and stones for
    communication, play, food gathering or eating, and comfort.[21] Each of the groups used the tools slightly
    differently, and this usage was passed from chimpanzee to chimpanzee within the group through a complex mix of
    imitation and social learning.[21]
    Chimpanzees[edit]
    In 1999, Whiten et al. examined data from 151 years of chimpanzee observation in an attempt to discover how much
    cultural variation existed between populations of the species. The synthesis of their studies consisted of two
    phases, in which they (1) created a comprehensive list of cultural variant behavior specific to certain populations
    of chimpanzees and (2) rated the behavior as either customary – occurring in all individuals within that population;
    habitual – not present in all individuals, but repeated in several individuals; present – neither customary or
    habitual but clearly identified; absent – instance of behavior not recorded and has no ecological explanation;
    ecological – absence of behavior can be attributed to ecological features or lack thereof in the environment, or of
    unknown origin. Their results were extensive: of the 65 categories of behavior studied, 39 (including grooming, tool
    usage and courtship behaviors) were found to be habitual in some communities but nonexistent in others.
    Whiten et al. further made sure that these local traditions were not due to differences in ecology, and defined
    cultural behaviors as behaviors that are "transmitted repeatedly through social or observational learning to become
    a population-level characteristic".[21] Eight years later, after "conducting large-scale controlled social-diffusion
    experiments with captive groups", Whiten et al. stated further that "alternative foraging techniques seeded in
    different groups of chimpanzees spread differentially...across two further groups with substantial fidelity".[45]
    This finding confirms not only that nonhuman species can maintain unique cultural traditions; it also shows that
    they can pass these traditions on from one population to another. The Whiten articles are a tribute to the unique
    inventiveness of wild chimpanzees, and help prove that humans' impressive capacity for culture and cultural
    transmission dates back to the now-extinct common ancestor we share with chimpanzees.[21]
    Similar to humans, social structure plays an important role in cultural transmission in chimpanzees. Victoria Horner
    conducted an experiment where an older, higher ranking individual and a younger, lower ranking individual were both
    taught the same task with only slight aesthetic modification.[46] She found that chimpanzees tended to imitate the
    behaviors of the older, higher ranking chimpanzee as opposed to the younger, lower ranking individual when given a
    choice. It is believed that the older higher ranking individual had gained a level of 'prestige' within the group.
    This research demonstrates that culturally transmitted behaviors are often learned from individuals that are
    respected by the group.
    The older, higher ranking individual's success in similar situations in the past led the other individuals to
    believe that their fitness would be greater by imitating the actions of the successful individual. This shows that
    not only are chimpanzees imitating behaviors of other individuals, they are choosing which individuals they should
    imitate in order to increase their own fitness. This type of behavior is very common in human culture as well.
    People will seek to imitate the behaviors of an individual that has earned respect through their actions. From this
    information, it is evident that the cultural transmission system of chimpanzees is more complex than previous
    research would indicate.
    Chimpanzees have been known to use tools for as long as they have been studied. Andrew Whiten found that chimpanzees
    not only use tools, but also conform to using the same method as the majority of individuals in the group.[47] This
    conformity bias is prevalent in human culture as well and is commonly referred to as peer pressure.
    The results from the research of Victoria Horner and Andrew Whiten show that chimpanzee social structures and human
    social structures have more similarities than previously thought.
    Cetacean culture[edit]
    Second only to non-human primates, culture in species within the order Cetacea, which includes whales, dolphins, and
    porpoises, has been studied for numerous years. In these animals, much of the evidence for culture comes from
    vocalizations and feeding behaviors.
    Cetacean vocalizations have been studied for many years, specifically those of the bottlenose dolphin, humpback
    whale, killer whale, and sperm whale. Since the early 1970s, scientists have studied these four species in depth,
    finding potential cultural attributes within group dialects, foraging, and migratory traditions. Hal Whitehead, a
    leading cetologist, and his colleagues conducted a study in 1992 of sperm whale groups in the South Pacific, finding
    that groups tended to be clustered based on their vocal dialects.[34] The differences in the whales' songs among and
    between the various groups could not be explained genetically or ecologically, and thus was attributed to social
    learning. In mammals such as these sperm whales or bottlenose dolphins, the decision on whether an animal has the
    capacity for culture comes from more than simple behavioral observations. As described by ecologist Brooke Sergeant,
    "on the basis of life-history characteristics, social patterns, and ecological environments, bottlenose dolphins
    have been considered likely candidates for socially learned and cultural behaviors," due to being large-brained and
    capable of vocal and motor imitation.[48]
    In dolphins, scientists have focused mostly on foraging and vocal behaviors, though many worry about the fact that
    social functions for the behaviors have not yet been found. As with primates, many humans are reluctantly willing,
    yet ever so slightly willing, to accept the notion of cetacean culture, when well evidenced, due to their similarity
    to humans in having "long lifetimes, advanced cognitive abilities, and prolonged parental care."[34]
    Matrilineal whales[edit]
    In the cases of three species of matrilineal cetaceans, pilot whales, sperm whales, and killer whales, mitochondrial
    DNA nucleotide diversities are about ten times lower than other species of whale.[49] Whitehead found that this low
    mtDNA nucleotide diversity yet high diversity in matrilineal whale culture may be attributed to cultural
    transmission, since learned cultural traits have the ability to have the same effect as normal maternally inherited
    mtDNA. The divergence of the sympatric resident and transient ecotypes of killer whale off Vancouver Island is
    attributed to differences in diet. The resident ecotype feeds on fish and a little squid, and the transient ecotype
    feeds on marine mammals.[50]
    Vocalizations have also been proven to be culturally acquired in killer and sperm whale populations, as evidenced by
    the distinct vocalization patterns maintained by members of these different populations even in cases where more
    than one population may occupy one home range.[49] Even within the same community clan, the three southern resident
    orca pods maintain unique, stable dialects separate from each other's, though they are associated and share some
    pulsed calls and whistles.[51][52] The majority of their vocalizations are repetitions of the same calls, referred
    to as discrete or stereotyped calls, recorded since the 1960s and passed on by the orcas from generation to
    generation.[51][53] A Southern Resident calf only learns the discrete calls used in the pod of their mother, though
    exposed to other calls in the clan.[54]
    Further study is being done in the matrilineal whales to uncover the cultural transmission mechanisms associated
    with other advanced techniques, such as migration strategies, new foraging techniques, and babysitting.[49]

    By using a "process of elimination" approach, researchers Krutzen et al.[55] reported evidence of culturally
    transmitted tool use in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.). It has been previously noted that tool use in foraging,
    called "sponging" exists in this species. "Sponging" describes a behavior where a dolphin will break off a marine
    sponge, wear it over its rostrum, and use it to probe for fish. Using various genetic techniques, Krutzen et al.
    showed that the behavior of "sponging" is vertically transmitted from the mother, with most spongers being female.
    Additionally, they found high levels of genetic relatedness from spongers suggesting recent ancestry and the
    existence of a phenomenon researchers call a "sponging eve".
    In order to make a case for cultural transmission as the mode of behavioral inheritance in this case, Krutzen et al.
    needed to rule out possible genetic and ecological explanations. Krutzen et al. refer to data that indicate both
    spongers and nonspongers use the same habitat for foraging. Using mitochondrial DNA data, Krutzen et al. found a
    significant non-random association between the types of mitochondrial DNA pattern and sponging. Because
    mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally, this result suggests sponging is passed from the mother.
    In a later study[56] one more possible explanation for the transmission of sponging was ruled out in favor of
    cultural transmission. Scientists from the same lab looked at the possibility that 1.) the tendency for "sponging"
    was due to a genetic difference in diving ability and 2.) that these genes were under selection. From a test of 29
    spongers and 54 nonspongers, the results showed that the coding mitochondrial genes were not a significant predictor
    of sponging behavior. Additionally, there was no evidence of selection in the investigated genes.
    Rat culture[edit]
    Notable research has been done with black rats and Norwegian rats.[57] Among studies of rat culture, the most widely
    discussed research is that performed by Joseph Terkel in 1991 on a species of black rats that he had originally
    observed in the wild in Israel. Terkel conducted an in-depth study aimed to determine whether the observed behavior,
    the systematic stripping of pine cone scales from pine cones prior to eating, was a socially acquired behavior, as
    this action had not been observed elsewhere. The experimentation with and observation of these black rats was one of
    the first to integrate field observations with laboratory experiments to analyze the social learning involved.[58]
    From the combination of these two types of research, Terkel was able to analyze the mechanisms involved in this
    social learning to determine that this eating behavior resulted from a combination of ecology and cultural
    transmission, as the rats could not figure out how to eat the pinecones without being "shown" by mature rats.[59]
    Though this research is fairly recent, it is often used as a prime example of evidence for culture in non-primate,
    non-cetacean beings. Animal migration may be in part cultural; released ungulates have to learn over generations the
    seasonal changes in local vegetation.[60][61]
    In the black rat (Rattus rattus), social transmission appears to be the mechanism of how optimal foraging techniques
    are transmitted. In this habitat, the rats’ only source of food is pine seeds that they obtain from pine cones.
    Terkel et al.[62] studied the way in which the rats obtained the seeds and the method that this strategy was
    transmitted to subsequent generations. Terkel et al. found that there was an optimal strategy for obtaining the
    seeds that minimized energy inputs and maximized outputs. Naïve rats that did not use this strategy could not learn
    it from trial and error or from watching experienced rats. Only young offspring could learn the technique.
    Additionally, from cross-fostering experiments where pups of naïve mothers were placed with experienced mothers and
    vice versa, those pups placed with experienced mothers
