  <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial
    animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa
    camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant
    species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven
    other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
    The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones,
    and its spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative,
    the okapi. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the
    west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits,
    and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot
    reach.
    Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related
    females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large
    aggregations. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
    Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for raising the young.
    The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been
    featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature
    (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes are still
    found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500
    members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.
    Etymology
    The name "giraffe" has its earliest known origins in the Arabic word zarāfah (زرافة),[2] ultimately from Persian
    زُرنَاپَا‎ (zurnāpā), a compound of زُرنَا‎ (zurnā, “flute, zurna”) and پَا‎ (pā, “leg”).[3][4] In early Modern
    English the spellings jarraf and ziraph were used, probably directly from the Arabic,[5] and in Middle English
    jarraf and ziraph, gerfauntz. The Italian form giraffa arose in the 1590s. The modern English form developed around
    1600 from the French girafe.[2]
    "Camelopard" /kəˈmɛləˌpɑːrd/ is an archaic English name for the giraffe; it derives from the Ancient Greek
    καμηλοπάρδαλις (kamēlopárdalis), from κάμηλος (kámēlos), "camel", and πάρδαλις (párdalis), "leopard", referring to
    its camel-like shape and leopard-like colouration.[6][7]
    Taxonomy
    Evolution
    The giraffe is one of only two living genera of the family Giraffidae in the order Artiodactyla, the other being the
    okapi. The family was once much more extensive, with over 10 fossil genera described.[8] The elongation of the neck
    appears to have started early in the giraffe lineage. Comparisons between giraffes and their ancient relatives
    suggest vertebrae close to the skull lengthened earlier, followed by lengthening of vertebrae further down.[9]
    One early giraffid ancestor was Canthumeryx which has been dated variously to have lived 25–20 million years ago
    (mya), 17–15 mya or 18–14.3 mya and whose deposits have been found in Libya. This animal resembled an antelope and
    had a medium-sized, lightly built body. Giraffokeryx appeared 15–12 mya on the Indian subcontinent and resembled an
    okapi or a small giraffe, and had a longer neck and similar ossicones.[8] Giraffokeryx may have shared a clade with
    more massively built giraffids like Sivatherium and Bramatherium.[9]

  <p>Giraffids like Palaeotragus, Shansitherium and Samotherium appeared 14 mya and lived throughout Africa and Eurasia.
    These animals had broader skull with reduced frontal cavities.[8][9] Paleotragus resembled the okapi and may have
    been its ancestor.[8] Others find that the okapi lineage diverged earlier, before Giraffokeryx.[9] Samotherium was a
    particularly important transitional fossil in the giraffe lineage, as the length and structure of its cervical
    vertebrae were between those of a modern giraffe and an okapi, and its neck posture was likely similar to the
    former.[11] Bohlinia, which first appeared in southeastern Europe and lived 9–7 mya, was likely a direct ancestor of
    the giraffe. Bohlinia closely resembled modern giraffes, having a long neck and legs and similar ossicones and
    dentition.[8]
    Bohlinia colonised China and northern India and produced the Giraffa which, around 7 mya, reached Africa. Climate
    changes led to the extinction of the Asian giraffes, while the African giraffes survived and radiated into new
    species. Living giraffes appear to have arisen around 1 mya in eastern Africa during the Pleistocene.[8] Some
    biologists suggest the modern giraffes descended from G. jumae;[12] others find G. gracilis a more likely candidate.
    G. jumae was larger and more robust, while G. gracilis was smaller and more slender.[8]
    The changes from extensive forests to more open habitats, which began 8 mya, are believed to be the main driver for
    the evolution of giraffes.[8] During this time, tropical plants disappeared and were replaced by arid C4 plants, and
    a dry savannah emerged across eastern and northern Africa and western India.[13][14] Some researchers have
    hypothesised that this new habitat coupled with a different diet, including acacia species, may have exposed giraffe
    ancestors to toxins that caused higher mutation rates and a higher rate of evolution.[15] The coat patterns of
    modern giraffes may also have coincided with these habitat changes. Asian giraffes are hypothesised to have had more
    okapi-like colourations.[8]
    The giraffe genome is around 2.9 billion base pairs in length compared to the 3.3 billion base pairs of the okapi.
    Of the proteins in giraffe and okapi genes, 19.4% are identical. The divergence of giraffe and okapi lineages dates
    to around 11.5 mya. A small group of regulatory genes in the giraffe appear to be responsible for the animal's
    height and associated circulatory adaptations.[16][17]
    Species and subspecies

    The extinct giraffid Samotherium (middle) in comparison with the okapi (below) and giraffe. The anatomy of
    Samotherium appears to have shown a transition to a giraffe-like neck.[11]
    The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) currently recognises only one species of giraffe with nine
    subspecies.[1]
    Carl Linnaeus originally classified living giraffes as one species in 1758. He gave it the binomial name Cervus
    camelopardalis. Mathurin Jacques Brisson coined the genus Giraffa in 1762.[18] During the 1900s, various taxonomies
    with two or three species were proposed.[19] A 2007 study on the genetics of giraffes using mitochondrial DNA
    suggested at least six lineages could be recognised as species.[20] A 2011 study using detailed analyses of the
    morphology of giraffes, and application of the phylogenetic species concept, described eight species of living
    giraffes.[21] A 2016 study also concluded that living giraffes consist of multiple species. The researchers
    suggested the existence of four species, which have not exchanged genetic information between each other for 1 to 2
    million years.[22]
    A 2020 study showed that depending on the method chosen, different taxonomic hypotheses recognizing from two to six
    species can be considered for the genus Giraffa.[23] That study also found that multi-species coalescent methods can
    lead to taxonomic over-splitting, as those methods delimit geographic structures rather than species. The
    three-species hypothesis, which recognises G. camelopardalis, G. giraffa, and G. tippelskirchi, is highly supported
    by phylogenetic analyses and also corroborated by most population genetic and multi-species coalescent analyses.[23]
    A 2021 whole genome sequencing study suggests the existence of four distinct species and seven subspecies.[24]
    The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic relationship between the four proposed species and seven subspecies based
    on the genome analysis.[24] Note the eight lineages correspond to eight of the traditional subspecies in the one
    species hypothesis. The Rothschild giraffe is subsumed into G. camelopardalis camelopardalis.
